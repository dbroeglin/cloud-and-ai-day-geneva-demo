# Run skills catalog

Reusable **run-phase** agent skills. Unlike the [build skills catalog](build-skills-catalog.md) (skills you install to help *build* the app), these are skills the **agent itself runs** at execution time.

**Reuse, don't regenerate.** When the prompt **explicitly names** one of these skills, reuse the existing skill instead of authoring a new `./skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` from scratch: install/download it into `./skills/<skill-name>/` as the repo authoring artifact, then **create or update the versioned skill on the Foundry project with `azd ai skill`** and attach it to the agent's toolbox. At runtime, the hosted agent downloads the governed skill version into temp through the same Copilot SDK skills default flow described in [`foundry-toolbox.md`](foundry-toolbox.md). Only author a brand-new skill when the named skill is **not** in this catalog.

This is a starter set of examples, not an exhaustive list.

For cataloged skills that declare a repository, install with the same command used for build skills:

```bash
gh skills install <repository> <skill> --agent github-copilot --scope project
```

Skills without a repository (`—`) are reused from their named source as agreed with the user; if they are not resolvable from a repository, reuse the local/cataloged version rather than authoring a new one. In all cases, after the skill is present locally, create and version it on Foundry and attach it to the toolbox.
