# User Story Generation Skill

Transform raw requirements into actionable, INVEST-compliant user stories ready for sprint planning.

## Core Process

### Step 1: Analyze Input

Read and understand the provided content:
- Meeting transcripts or notes
- Feature requests or requirements documents.
- Stakeholder conversations
- Product vision statements

### Step 2: Identify Pain Points

Extract both explicit and implicit pain points:
- **Explicit**: Directly stated problems in the text
- **Implicit**: Inferred needs (e.g., request for automation implies manual process is tedious)

Consult `references/invest_and_splitting.md` for pain point analysis techniques.

### Step 3: Generate User Stories

Create stories using the format:
```
As a [type of user],
I want [goal/desire],
given [context/constraints],
so that [benefit/value].
```

**Requirements:**
- Each story must have a clear pain point it addresses
- Stories must be Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable (INVEST)
- Keep stories small enough to complete in 1-3 days
- Stories should be vertically sliced (not technical layers)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
For each story, generate 2-4 testable acceptance criteria using Given/When/Then format:
```
- Given [initial context], when [action occurs], then [expected outcome]
- Given [initial context], when [action occurs], then [expected outcome]
```

Acceptance criteria should:
- Be specific and testable
- Cover the main success scenarios
- Include edge cases where relevant
- Be clear enough for QA to validate

Consult `references/invest_and_splitting.md` for INVEST criteria details and story-splitting techniques when stories are too large.

### Step 4: Organize Stories

Group related stories into logical categories/epics:
- By feature area (e.g., "User Authentication", "Payment Processing")
- By user journey (e.g., "Onboarding", "Checkout Flow")
- By system component (e.g., "Admin Dashboard", "Mobile App")

### Step 5: Ask for Output Format

Always ask the user which output format they prefer:
- **CSV**: Best for importing to Excel/Google Sheets
- **Markdown Table**: Best for documentation, Notion, GitHub
- **JSON**: Best for programmatic processing or API integration
- **Excel (.xlsx)**: Best for formatted spreadsheets with styling

Do NOT assume a format - always ask first.

### Step 6: Generate Output

#### Required Columns

Every story must include these seven fields:
1. **category_epic**: High-level grouping for related stories
2. **title**: Brief summary (5-10 words)
3. **user_story**: Complete story in "As a... I want... given... so that..." format
4. **acceptance_criteria**: 2-4 testable criteria in Given/When/Then format (bullet points)
5. **requirement**: Original requirement or feature description from input
6. **pain_point**: The specific problem this story solves
7. **created_date**: Today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format

#### CSV Format
```csv
Category/Epic,Title,User Story,Acceptance Criteria,Requirement,Pain Point,Created Date
User Authentication,Login with Email,"As a returning user, I want to log in with my email and password, given I have an existing account, so that I can access my personalized content","- Given valid credentials, when I submit the login form, then I am redirected to my dashboard
- Given invalid credentials, when I submit the login form, then I see an error message
- Given I am already logged in, when I navigate to the login page, then I am redirected to my dashboard","Users need to access their accounts","Users cannot access their saved preferences",2026-01-29
```

#### Markdown Table Format
```markdown
| Category/Epic | Title | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Requirement | Pain Point | Created Date |
|---------------|-------|------------|---------------------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| User Authentication | Login with Email | As a returning user... | - Given valid credentials, when I submit the login form, then I am redirected to my dashboard<br>- Given invalid credentials, when I submit the login form, then I see an error message | Users need to... | Users cannot... | 2026-01-29 |
```

#### JSON Format
```json
[
  {
    "category_epic": "User Authentication",
    "title": "Login with Email",
    "user_story": "As a returning user, I want to log in with my email and password, given I have an existing account, so that I can access my personalized content",
    "acceptance_criteria": "- Given valid credentials, when I submit the login form, then I am redirected to my dashboard\n- Given invalid credentials, when I submit the login form, then I see an error message\n- Given I am already logged in, when I navigate to the login page, then I am redirected to my dashboard",
    "requirement": "Users need to access their accounts",
    "pain_point": "Users cannot access their saved preferences",
    "created_date": "2026-01-29"
  }
]
```

#### Excel Format

For Excel output:
1. Generate the JSON format first
2. Save JSON to a temporary file (e.g., `/home/claude/stories.json`)
3. Run the Excel generation script with today's date in filename:
   ```bash
   cd /home/claude/user-story-generation/scripts
   python3 generate_excel.py --input /home/claude/stories.json --output /home/claude/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_userstories.xlsx
   ```
4. Move the generated file to outputs:
   ```bash
   mv /home/claude/*_userstories.xlsx /mnt/user-data/outputs/
   ```
5. Present the Excel file to the user

The script automatically applies formatting:
- Colored header row (blue background, white text)
- Frozen header for scrolling
- Wrapped text for readability
- Optimized column widths
- Professional borders
- Seven columns: Category/Epic, Title, User Story, Acceptance Criteria, Requirement, Pain Point, Created Date

## Quality Guidelines

**Story Title:**
- Keep to 5-10 words
- Descriptive and actionable
- Avoid technical jargon

**User Story:**
- Always use full "As a... I want... given... so that..." format
- Be specific about user type (admin, customer, guest, etc.)
- Include meaningful context in "given" clause
- Articulate clear value in "so that" clause

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Write 2-4 criteria per story in Given/When/Then format
- Each criterion should be independently testable
- Cover main success path and key edge cases
- Be specific about expected outcomes
- Use bullet points for readability
- Example format: "- Given [context], when [action], then [outcome]"

**Requirement:**
- Extract the original requirement from input text
- Keep concise but informative
- Preserve key details from original source

**Pain Point:**
- State the specific problem being solved
- Connect to user or business value
- One clear pain point per story

## Common Patterns

**Authentication Stories:**
- Category: "User Authentication" or "Security"
- Pain points: Access control, security concerns, user experience

**Data Management Stories:**
- Category: "Data Management" or "[Entity] Management"
- Pain points: Manual processes, data accuracy, efficiency

**Reporting/Analytics Stories:**
- Category: "Reporting" or "Analytics"
- Pain points: Lack of visibility, manual reporting, decision-making delays

**Integration Stories:**
- Category: "Integrations" or "Third-Party Services"
- Pain points: Manual data transfer, system disconnects, workflow inefficiency
